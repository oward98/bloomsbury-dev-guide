            <h2>Problems that need to be solved to protect the CAs.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bad development:</strong> Development proposals, by the time they reach us, are often absurdly inappropriate.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor appreciation of heritage:</strong> Camden's planners and councillors do not have a good sense of Bloomsbury's importance, nor how development could enhance Bloomsbury.</li>
                <li><strong>No tailored policies:</strong> Bloomsbury does not have any tailored policies or guidance, except for an outdated appraisal and generic management plan.</li>
                <li><strong>So-called 'nimbyism': </strong>Our opposition to development is often characterised as being arbitrary opposition to any kind of development, rather than based on sound logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor relations: </strong>We don't ever 'reward' Camden's planners or developers - we only object. This is poor for relations, and risks a perception that it is impossible to do good by us.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Proposed Site: Bloomsbury Development Guide.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Tests that we apply to development. An exhaustive list of aspects of development which make it good or bad for Bloomsbury, each with a short exposition, and plenty of photos to demonstrate the point.</li>
                <li><strong>Development Ratings:</strong> i.e. Canonical Buildings. We judge different developments <em>based on </em> those principles, and give an overall score. A short exposition, and plenty of photos.</li>
                <li><strong>Bloomsbury Vernacular:</strong> lots and lots of photos of Bloomsbury's vernacular, with short descriptions of each photo. Like a visual appraisal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The site should be very simple, and very visual with lots of photos to make it easy to digest, and 'scrollable', so that it doesn't seem like a burden to engage with Bloomsbury's heritage. Website precedent for this could be Pinterest, Instagram, etc. Photos should be of very high quality.</p>
            <h2>How this helps.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bad development:</strong> At a very early stage, developers and planners alike can visit the site to see where previous developments have failed, and succeeded. They get an idea of how development should be produced to minimise opposition. Hopefully this will result in generally better development by the time it reaches us.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor appreciation of heritage: </strong>The 'Vernacular' section should be a very easy to digest, scrollable, 'Pinterest' style page with a large number of photos showing Bloomsbury's beauty. In this way, it should be able to communicate the importance of Bloomsbury's built environment.</li>
                <li><strong>No tailored policies: </strong>E.g. with the Seven Dials Renaissance Study, 'community-based' guidance documents can be given weight in planning decisions. There is no reason why this site couldn't be the same.</li>
                <li><strong>So-called 'nimbyism': </strong>Explaining our principles and applying them in a very rational way (through ratings) removes this idea (hopefully). Our opposition becomes more scientific and precise. We are also shown to encourage certain types of development.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor relations: </strong>Given the inclusion of positive examples of buildings, it should communicate to developers/planners that good can be done by us. Also possibly working with Camden's planners on this should make relations better.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>In light of planning reforms.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Proposed planning reforms will streamline the planning process, with local authorities required to create local plans which set out a clear set of 'tests' for development, rather than general policies. The new local plans are expected to be just a third of their current length. This new approach sounds very much like the above approach of setting out our 'tests', and applying them through ratings.</li>
                <li>The planning reforms also emphasise the importance of 'building beautiful'. Local authorities will be obliged to create 'design guides' for different areas, something like 'pattern books' of old, with strong community involvement. This sounds very much like the proposed 'Vernacular' section.</li>
                <li>If we can cobble this together before the planning reforms are instituted, we have a chance of influencing policy decisions in Bloomsbury and wider Camden. This is the only way we can realistically make long term positive change.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Work that would be required.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Work out our tests, and how much weight to assign to each.</li>
                <li>Collect examples of new development in Bloomsbury CAs, and apply those tests.</li>
                <li>Photos: I already have 1000s of photos of the CAs I've taken over the years.</li>
                <li>It's just important that we all work on this to make it truly representative of our thinking on development.</li>
            </ol>
