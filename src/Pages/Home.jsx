            <h2>Development Site: Bloomsbury Development Guide.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Tests that we apply to development. An exhaustive list of aspects of development which make it good or bad for the Bloomsbury CAs, each with a short exposition, and plenty of photos to demonstrate the point.</li>
                <li><strong>Development Ratings:</strong> i.e. Canonical Buildings. We judge different developments <em>based on </em> those principles, and give an overall score. A short exposition, and plenty of photos.</li>
                <li><strong>Vernacular:</strong> lots and lots of photos of Bloomsbury's vernacular, with short descriptions of each photo. Like a visual appraisal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The site should be very simple, and very visual with lots of photos to make it easy to digest, and 'scrollable', so that it doesn't seem like a burden to engage with Bloomsbury's heritage. Website precedent for this could be Pinterest, Instagram, etc. Photos should be of very high quality.</p>
            <h2>Working examples</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Development Ratings >> Redevelopment</li>
                <li>Vernacular >> Building Typology >> Terrace</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>In light of planning reforms.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Proposed planning reforms will streamline the planning process, with local authorities required to create local plans which set out a clear set of 'tests' for development, rather than general policies. The new local plans are expected to be just a third of their current length. This new approach sounds very much like the above approach of setting out our 'tests', and applying them through ratings.</li>
                <li>The planning reforms also emphasise the importance of 'building beautiful'. Local authorities will be obliged to create 'design guides' for different areas, something like 'pattern books' of old, with strong community involvement. This sounds very much like the proposed 'Vernacular' section.</li>
                <li>If we can cobble this together before the planning reforms are instituted, we have a chance of influencing policy decisions in Bloomsbury and wider Camden. This is the only way we can realistically make long term positive change.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Work that would be required.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Work out our tests, and how much weight to assign to each.</li>
                <li>Collect examples of new development in Bloomsbury CAs, and apply those tests.</li>
                <li>Photos: I already have 1000s of photos of the CAs I've taken over the years.</li>
            </ol>
